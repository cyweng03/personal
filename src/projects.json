In this paper, I developed an image-based land-use classNameifier using transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-18 convolutional neural network using PyTorch. I demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning for image classNameification by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the resulting data. I identified key trends and insights from the data, and presented the results in a clear and concise manner.",
